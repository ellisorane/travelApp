## Travel Planner app

This project is a one page app utilizes all the topics I've learned in 
the Udacity Front End Developer course. The app takes the user's input 
of a city they want to visit as well as when they plan to go and returns
the weather in that city for the day the user added as well an image of
that place. The user also has the option of adding and deleting notes
for their trips.

## Instructions
To use the app simply open the terminal, run `npm install`. After that 
run `npm run prod` and then `npm run server`. Afterwards open the url 
shown in the terminal. After opening the webapge, follow the instructions 
provided on the form. Hit submit and wait for the response. The response 
will show up to the right of the form along with an image relating to your
response.
